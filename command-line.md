THE COMMAND LINE
The command line is like going under the  hood (to use a car analogy). If you need to do something (e.g. open a file or save a new file) and the usual method of using the mouse or keyboard to make things happen (e.g. save a file or open a file) in applications (e.g. Word or Excel) doesn't work then you can use the command line. How this works is that you go straight to the engine and wheels to tell it what to do rather than relying on an intermediary such as applications (or to go back to the car analogy the steering wheel or gas pedals) to deliver the message to the computer (engine/wheels). Of course, this isn't the only time you would use the command line. You would use it more often as a programmer for example to supplement coding you do with other applications.
